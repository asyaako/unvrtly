# Server Selector GUI
# The ID of this inventory is 'serverselector' which you can open using the [MENU] action (e.g. "[MENU] serverselector").
# You can create more custom GUIs, just copy this entire file and paste a new one in the menus directory. The name of the file is the menu ID.
#
# PLAYER HEADS
#   You can have player heads, using player names, base64 or HeadDatabase IDs.
#   Examples
#     Username (must have logged into the server once)
#       material: PLAYER_HEAD
#       username: <name>

#     Base64

#       base64: <base64 id>

#     HeadDatabase
